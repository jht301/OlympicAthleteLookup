**Project Overview**
This project analyzes historical Olympic data to predict athlete performance in the upcoming 2024 Paris Olympics. We focused on the 2021 Tokyo Olympics and prior datasets to identify patterns and factors that contribute to an athlete's likelihood of winning in their respective sports.

**Features**

- Historical data analysis of Olympic performance
- Identification of top-performing countries
- Analysis of consecutive wins and their impact on future performance
- Age-based performance trends
- Athlete lookup tool with performance prediction

**Technologies Used**

- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- IPython widgets

**Key Findings**

1. **Top Performing Countries:** We identified the top 10 countries that consistently perform well in the Olympic games over the years.
2. **Consecutive Wins:** Our analysis shows that athletes who win in two consecutive games are less likely to win in their third appearance, indicating a potential performance plateau.
3. **Age and Performance:** The majority of medals are awarded to athletes between 20 and 29 years old, with a significant decrease in medal counts for older age groups.
4. **Athlete Performance Predictor:** We developed a tool that calculates a ranking for individual athletes based on various criteria, including past performance, age, and country of origin.

**How to Use**
1. Run the analysis scripts to generate visualizations and insights.
2. Use the athlete lookup tool to predict performance for specific athletes in the 2024 Paris Olympics.

**Future Improvements**

- Incorporate more recent data as it becomes available
- Refine the prediction algorithm with machine learning techniques
- Expand the analysis to include more sports-specific factors
